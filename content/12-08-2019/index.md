# The general structure of a resume

Resumes consist of different sections. These sections can include different topics but the most common are Personal Information, Education, Experience and Projects, Volunteering, Skills and Interests. In most of the cases Skills and Interests are put together in the same category. Listing interests is quite a controversial topic and I would not recommend to include the interests if the company does not seem too interested in them.

These sections are normally listed horizontally below each other. Each section has some kind of heading and then the content. The content can be structured quite differently but as I have stated in [previous article of this series](/the-ultimate-guide-writing-a-software-engineer-resume/) the content is the important bit of these sections. Some designs also propose vertically split resumes but personally I have found these resumes harder to read because the human is used to read from top to bottom. This also makes it harder for recruiters and hiring managers to read the resume, so please avoid the vertically splitted layout in resumes.

## Make your resume 1 page

As you will learn in the next blog article of this series "WIP The 10 Second Rule for resumes", resumes should be short. The single reason for this is that hiring managers and recruiters look around 10 seconds on your resume and you need to catch their eyes. Having multiple pages does not really work towards this rule. It could be the case, that your biggest achievements are listed on the second or third page of your resume but the recruiter or hiring manager will never look at this since they just look at the first page and decide to reject or go forward with another candidate.

Another reason for a one page resume is that you will be forced to actually write good content. The content should be short and concise but attract people. It forces you basically to write good content. The specific content will be discussed in the next chapters but it is better to keep yourself short when you have a lot of content anyway. If you do not have a lot of content, you can still try to formulate your sentences in a short way. It will be good for you because for most of your statements about work or personal projects you should use the STAR methodology. It consists of the steps Situation, task, action, result and should be applied throughout most of your resume. Also making these short statements will showcase your ability to communicate well and efficient. It is an important skill as a software engineer. Software engineers who can communicate well with product owners, stakeholders and other software engineers are more successful in their career. They can communicate targets more clear and are better at creating plans for possible outcomes. A skill which is really important as problem-solver what software engineers are.

The one page resume will also enforce that you will have a clear and condense design. In most of the cases the designs of resumes are quite cluttered. You will not use a lot of whitespace if you have a lot of content and thats good since you will be still on one page. It will make your resume also a lot more organized.

## The order of your resume sections is important

People tend to read from top to bottom and getting the hiring manager or the recruiter interested in your resume is the hardest part of writing it actually. The order of your sections will matter actually. If you have work experience, I always recommend to do use the following structure.

1. The header with personal information
1. Work Experience
1. Projects
1. Education
1. Technical Skills

The work experience is what most hiring managers and recruiters are looking for. The rest of the sections can be structured as you like it. Normally it should show your strengths first. If you have a well-known project on GitHub or contributed extensively to Open Source you could put projects above education like in the list before. But if you studied at a well-known university it might be also good to put the education in front of the work experience.

If you have no work experience and no internships structuring your resume will be a lot harder. You should instead first work on bringing up quality projects with good READMEs on GitHub and actually solving real problems. These projects are the most worthful. For example, I created a case converter online tool which you can find [here](https://caseconverter.pro/app). It solves a problem and does not look too bad. But again, do not feel pressured with your projects, it will just give you an advantage to other applicants. The following order, I would prefer if you do not have relevant work experience.

1. The header with personal information
1. Projects
1. Education
1. Technical Skills

If your education is really good, you could also swap the Projects section with the Education. By having a good education I mean that you participated in some key research or went to a prestigious university.

Technical skills I would always list as last skill and do not put a lot of emphasis on it. Most often the skills section is just getting parsed by an ATS (Application tracking system) and that is it. To have a parsable resume, the most important fact is that the text content of your resume is copyable. To check this, you can open the final resume in Google Chrome and see if you can mark the text in the PDF and copy it into some text editor. If this is possible, it is really likely your resume can be parsed by the Application tracking systems.
