# The Header of your Resume

The header of your resume is most probably the first part the hiring manager or recruiter will look at. As always it should be as short as possible and give the maximum information possible. The important thing is that personal information should appear there. Details like your name and general links to your social media profile should be included. In detail this will be discussed later.

As learned in the last chapter the first impression is really important. But the content for the header should not be too catchy. The focus of the hiring manager should be probably pointed to your name and the rest of the information should be ignored for the first look. The resume should really point to the next section which should be the work experience.

## Information to give in the header of a resume

The information in the header can be split into two sections. One is the required information and one is the optional information. The necessary information should be listed in every resume and in every design, no matter how much space you have left. The optional parameters can be left out if you do not have enough space because these details are not needed and could distract more than they are worth it. The required information include:

- Name
- Phone Number
- Email

These are quite obvious. In general your name should be the main part of the header. The phone number and email are more important to find fast when the recruiter wants to contact the applicant to introduce them to the continuation of the resume process. Email and phone number should be also easy to parse. A secret tip is also to hyperlink the email and phone number in the resume. The phone number might be not really required to hyperlink, but the email should be clickable. This is because most of the recruiters and hiring managers do not print your resume out anymore. It is a PDF on their computer or in the application tracking system (ATS).

The non-required information are listed below:

- GitHub
- LinkedIn
- Personal Web Page
- City
- Visa Status

All of them really depends on the status around your person. The conditions are explained in the following sub chapters.

### GitHub

The GitHub link should be included if you have a strong GitHub profile. This includes several different things. An overall score can be checked at [codersrank.io](https://codersrank.io). It is a good side as overview.

In detail you should have at least two projects. These two projects could be whatever you want to do. It could range from npm libraries to complete full stack web applications. The important thing is that you are solving a problem. These problems can be wide-ranged and problems exist everywhere. Think about the last week of yourself and what kind of specific problem might be solved or supported by using an application. If you cannot find these ideas, write them down the next time you have some problem. You need to be creative and do not block yourself on creating something just because it exists. There are a lot of specializations you can apply to make your application unique.

Another neccesity is that you write a good readme for all of the projects. It is important for marketing reasons that your readme just rocks. It should be clear and concise and filled with a lot of good examples. The best readmes are probably with a short headline and a summary text on what your software is doing. It should catch other developers or users of the readme. Adding a logo also looks professional and kind of slick. There are free logo creators all over the internet you could try but I will summarize how to write a good GitHub README at some point. You can find the related issue in my blog's board [here](https://github.com/igeligel/personal-site/issues/88).

### LinkedIn

Another social profile is the LinkedIn profile. A good LinkedIn profile has a good personal image first. Your face should be seen and your name on the profile should be nationalized to the country you are in. For example, an arabic name might scare people off.

The next section of the LinkedIn profile is the about section which should hold one or two sentences on what you want to actually get. It should include key target words so recruiters and hiring managers can find you easily on the platform. In the about section you can link also external resources like your GitHub or your resume. These give recruiters another resource for you.

Otherwise, you should fill out all of the other sections like Experience, Education, Skills & Endorsments, ask friends for recommendations, put on some accomplishments, describe your projects in there and add some interests.

### Personal Web Page

### City

### Visa Status

## Information to not provider in the header of a resume

- Picture - people can get on linkedin
- Social Media like Facebook, Instagram or Snapchat
- Full address

## The design of the header

## Keep the personal stuff short. It's not about the person but about the accomplishments
