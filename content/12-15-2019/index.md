# The Header of your Resume

The header of your resume is most probably the first part the hiring manager or recruiter will look at. As always it should be as short as possible and give the maximum information possible. The important thing is that personal information should appear there. Details like your name and general links to your social media profile should be included. In detail this will be discussed later.

As learned in the last chapter the first impression is really important. But the content for the header should not be too catchy. The focus of the hiring manager should be probably pointed to your name and the rest of the information should be ignored for the first look. The resume should really point to the next section which should be the work experience.

## Information to give in the header of a resume

The information in the header can be split into two sections. One is the required information and one is the optional information. The necessary information should be listed in every resume and in every design, no matter how much space you have left. The optional parameters can be left out if you do not have enough space because these details are not needed and could distract more than they are worth it. The required information include:

- Name
- Phone Number
- Email

These are quite obvious. In general your name should be the main part of the header. The phone number and email are more important to find fast when the recruiter wants to contact the applicant to introduce them to the continuation of the resume process. Email and phone number should be also easy to parse. A secret tip is also to hyperlink the email and phone number in the resume. The phone number might be not really required to hyperlink, but the email should be clickable. This is because most of the recruiters and hiring managers do not print your resume out anymore. It is a PDF on their computer or in the application tracking system (ATS).

The non-required information are listed below:

- GitHub
- LinkedIn
- Personal Web Page
- City
- Visa Status

All of them really depends on the status around your person. The conditions are explained in the following sub chapters.
