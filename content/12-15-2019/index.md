# The Header of your Resume

The header of your resume is most probably the first part the hiring manager or recruiter will look at. As always it should be as short as possible and give the maximum information possible. The important thing is that personal information should appear there. Details like your name and general links to your social media profile should be included. In detail this will be discussed later.

As learned in the last chapter the first impression is really important. But the content for the header should not be too catchy. The focus of the hiring manager should be probably pointed to your name and the rest of the information should be ignored for the first look. The resume should really point to the next section which should be the work experience.

## Information to give in the header of a resume

## Information to not provider in the header of a resume

## Keep the personal stuff short. It's not about the person but about the accomplishments
