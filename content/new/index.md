# A guide to recruit Software Engineers through LinkedIn

a-guide-to-recruit-software-engineers-through-linkedin

- Research the person

- Consider the current position of the person

- Consider experience of the person
- University / Coding bootcamp
- Experience at companies
- experience at bigger companies can be valued higher

- Did the person go from small company to big company, then it is more likely they will stay at big companies in the future
- Also list company size, revenue in the last years and whats their main business
- There is a difference for software engineers working at a tech company and a car company, for example Klarna vs. Volkswagen

- Consider if you really have to offer something for this person, otherwise do not bother them

- Do not write short messages like: Hey, whats up? Rather give more details of the job

- Learn about the tech stack of the job, and what challenges are offered there, engineers are different and seek different challenges (scale, producty things, bootstrapping / startups)

- Be open about compensation, list ranges rather than up to salaries

- Try to be interested in the software engineer, it always seems that you just care about selling your jobs

- Ask if the software engineers like to first talk via email/LinkedIn or via call. It gives them an option to prepare in different ways but make sure you want to have a phone call at some point.

- Do not contact software engineers on their work email
